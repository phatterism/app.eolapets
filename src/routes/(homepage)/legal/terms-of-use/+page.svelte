		<h2>Terms of Service</h2>
		<h4>Welcome to Eola Pets</h4>
		<p>
			These Terms of Service constitute a legally binding agreement (the "Terms") between you and
			Eola Pets ("Eola Pets," "we," "us" or "our") governing your use of Eola Pets applications,
			websites, contents, products, and/or services (the "Services"). By accessing or using the
			Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. Please read them carefully.
		</p>
		<p>
			Eola Pets provides an online venue that allows pet owners and third-party pet care service
			providers ("Pet Care Providers") to connect with each other using Services made available by
			Eola Pets LLC. and its parents, subsidiaries, representatives, affiliates, officers and
			directors (collectively, "Eola Pets"). Eola Pets has no control over the conduct of Pet Care
			Providers, or any other users of the Services.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please be advised: These Terms contain provisions that govern how claims that you and Eola
			Pets have against each other can be brought (see below). These provisions will, with limited
			exception, require that you submit claims you have against Eola Pets to binding and final
			arbitration on an individual basis, not as a plaintiff or class member in any class, group or
			representative action or proceeding.
		</p>
		<p>
			Eola Pets may amend the Terms and modify or update the Services from time to time. Your
			continued use of the Services after any such changes are posted here will constitute your
			acceptance of the amended Terms.
		</p>
		<p>
			By agreeing to these Terms, you expressly acknowledge that you understand the Terms (including
			the dispute resolution and arbitration provisions contained herein) and accept all of them. If
			you do not agree to be bound by these Terms, you may not use or access the Services.
		</p>
		<h4>Your Representations And Warranties</h4>

			You represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years old and legally entitled to enter
			these Terms, and that you have the authority and capacity to enter into and abide by these
			Terms.
		</p>
		<p>You further agree and warrant that:</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Your Information.</strong>
			All information that you provide to Eola Pets or through the Services is true and accurate, and
			you will maintain that information up-to-date. You will provide us with whatever proof of identity
			we may reasonably request. You will keep secure and confidential your account password or any identification
			we provide you which allows access to the Services.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Account Circumvention.</strong>
			You will not use the Services to identify pet owners or Pet Care Providers to complete offline
			transactions that circumvent your payment obligations for the Services. You may not authorize others
			to use your user status, and you may not assign or otherwise transfer your user account to any
			other person or entity.
		</p>
		<p>

			You will comply with all applicable state, federal, and local laws while using the Services. You
			will not copy or distribute the Services without written permission from Eola Pets.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Access and Use.</strong>
			You may only access the Services using authorized means. You will not use the Services for any
			fraudulent purposes or to cause nuisance, annoyance or inconvenience. It is your responsibility
			to ensure you have the correct software and equipment for use with the Services. You will only
			use an access point or data account that you are authorized to use. Eola Pets reserves the right
			to terminate your use of the Services if you use an incompatible or unauthorized device.

		<h4>License Grant</h4>
		<p>
			Subject to your compliance with these Terms, Eola Pets grants you a limited, non-exclusive,
			non-transferable, revocable license to access and use the Services solely for your own
			personal, non-commercial purposes. All rights not expressly granted to you are reserved by
			Eola Pets and its licensors.
		</p>
		<h4>Pet Owner Obligations</h4>
		<p>
			Pet owners warrant and agree that: (1) your pets are free from fleas, ticks, and other pests;
			and (2) you will have your pets fully vaccinated and up to date on all forms of preventative
			medicine prior to receiving services from a Pet Care Provider.
		</p>
		<h4>Payment Terms</h4>
		<p>
			You understand that use of the Services may result in charges to you for the services you
			receive from a Pet Care Provider. After you have received services or goods obtained through
			your use of the Services, Eola Pets will facilitate your payment of the applicable charges on
			behalf of the Pet Care Provider, as such Pet Care Provider's limited payment collection agent.
			Payment of such charges in such manner shall be considered the same as payment made directly
			by you to the Pet Care Provider. Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required
			by law. Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Eola
			Pets. You retain the right to request lower charges from a Pet Care Provider for services
			received by you from such Third Party Provider at the time you receive such services or goods.
			Eola Pets will respond accordingly to any request from a Pet Care Provider to modify charges
			for a particular service.
		</p>
		<p>
			All charges are due immediately and payment will be facilitated by Eola Pets using the
			preferred payment method designated in your Eola Pets account, after which Eola Pets will send
			you a receipt by email. If your primary payment method is determined to be expired, invalid or
			otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that Eola Pets may, as the Pet Care Provider's
			limited payment collection agent, use a secondary payment method in your account, if
			available.
		</p>
		<p>
			As between you and Eola Pets, Eola Pets reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise
			charges for any or all services obtained through the use of the Services at any time in Eola
			Pets' sole discretion. Eola Pets will use reasonable efforts to inform you of charges that may
			apply, provided that you will be responsible for charges incurred under your Eola Pets account
			regardless of your awareness of such charges or the amounts thereof. Eola Pets may from time
			to time provide certain users with promotional offers and discounts that may result in
			different amounts charged for the same or similar services obtained through the use of the
			Services, and you agree that such promotional offers and discounts, unless also made available
			to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Services or the charges applied to you. You
			may elect to cancel your request for services from a Pet Care Provider at any time prior to
			such Pet Care Provider's arrival, in which case you may be charged a cancellation fee.
		</p>
		<p>
			This payment structure is intended to fully compensate the Pet Care Provider for the services
			provided. Eola Pets does not designate any portion of your payment as a tip or gratuity to the
			Pet Care Provider. Any representation by Eola Pets to the effect that tipping is "voluntary,"
			"not required," and/or "included" in the payments you make for services or goods provided is
			not intended to suggest that Eola Pets provides any additional amounts, beyond those described
			above, to the Pet Care Provider. You understand and agree that, while you are free to provide
			additional payment as a gratuity to any Pet Care Provider who provides you with services
			obtained through the Services, you are under no obligation to do so. Gratuities are voluntary.
			After you have received services or goods obtained through the Services, you will have the
			opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional feedback about your Pet Care
			Provider.
		</p>
		<h4>Consent To Autodialed Text Messages And Phone Calls</h4>
		<p>
			You agree that Eola Pets may contact you by autodialed text messages and phone calls with
			information about the Services, your account, and with marketing messages, even if your phone
			number is on a do-not-call list. You are not required to provide this consent as a condition
			of purchasing anything or using the Services, and may opt out at any time by contacting
			customer care at
			<a href="sms:4079177384">(407)-917-7384</a>
			. In the event you change or deactivate your mobile telephone number, you agree to promptly update
			your Eola Pets account information to ensure that your messages are not sent to the person that
			acquires your old number.
		</p>
		<h4>Consent To Call Recording</h4>
		<p>
			You agree that any phone calls to or from Eola Pets may be monitored or recorded for quality
			assurance purposes.
		</p>
		<h4>Consent To Walker Photo And Video Activities</h4>
		<p>
			You understand and agree that certain Pet Care Providers may take pictures, videos, and other
			forms of recorded media of your pet during the course of providing Services to you. You
			further understand and agree that Pet Care Providers may post, upload, share, store, or
			otherwise provide any such pictures, videos, or other forms of recorded media to Eola Pets
			through the Services. You understand and agree that such recorded media may be used not only
			to provide information to you as part of the Services, but also to assist Eola Pets in quality
			control, safety, and promotional and marketing activities. You agree that you have no right,
			title, or other ownership interest to or in such pictures, videos, or other forms of recorded
			media, and that the use of such media, including the posting or display of such media, is
			within Eola Pets' sole discretion.
		</p>
		<h4>Eola Pets Intellectual Property</h4>
		<p>
			Eola Pets alone (and its licensors, where applicable) shall own all of the right, title and
			interest (including all related intellectual property rights), in and to the past, present,
			and future versions of the Services and all content therein. This content shall include, but
			is not limited to all layout, text, illustrations, instructions, files, images, designs,
			software, scripts, graphics, photos, sounds, music, videos, information, materials,
			technology, interactive features, the "look and feel" of the Services, the compilation and
			arrangement of the Services, Eola Pets trademarks, all copyrightable material (including
			source code and object code) and derivative works or enhancements of any of the above, unless
			ownership rights remain with a user as part of a User Submission, as described in the User
			Content section below.
		</p>
		<p>
			Eola Pets alone (and its licensors, where applicable) shall also own all of the right, title,
			and interest (including all related intellectual property right), in and to any suggestions,
			ideas, enhancement requests, feedback, recommendations or other information provided by you or
			any other party relating to the Services.
		</p>
		<p>
			These Terms are not a sale and do not convey to you any rights of ownership in or related to
			the Services, or any intellectual property rights owned by Eola Pets. The Eola Pets name, Eola
			Pets logo, and the product names associated with the Services are trademarks of Eola Pets or
			third parties, and no right or license is granted to use them.
		</p>
		<h4>Copyright and Alleged Intellectual Property Violations by Users</h4>
		<p>
			You may have heard of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the "DMCA"), as it relates to
			online service providers, like Eola Pets, being asked to remove material that allegedly
			violates someone's copyright. We respect others' intellectual property rights, and we reserve
			the right to delete or disable content alleged to be infringing any intellectual property
			rights at our sole discretion, and to terminate the accounts of repeat alleged infringers; to
			review our complete Copyright Dispute Policy and learn how to report potentially infringing
			content, please email
			<a href="mailto:support@eolapets.com">support@eolapets.com</a>
			. To learn more about the DMCA, click here.
		</p>
		<h4>User Content</h4>
		<p>
			Anything you post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide through the Services is your
			"User Submission." Some User Submissions are viewable by other users. In order to display your
			User Submissions on the Services, and to allow other users to enjoy them (where applicable),
			you grant us certain rights in those User Submissions. Please note that all of the following
			licenses are subject to our Privacy Policy
			<a href="/legal/privacy-policy"> https://eolapets.com/legal/privacy-policy </a>
			to the extent they relate to User Submissions that are also your personally-identifiable information.
		</p>
		<p>
			For all User Submissions, you hereby grant Eola Pets a license to translate, modify (for
			technical purposes, for example making sure your content is viewable on an iPhone as well as a
			computer) and reproduce and otherwise act with respect to such User Submissions, in each case
			to enable us to operate the Services, as described in more detail below. This is a license
			only – your ownership in User Submissions is not affected. However, pursuant to the
			Intellectual Property Terms &amp; Conditions above, Eola Pets alone (and its licensors, where
			applicable) shall own all right, title and interest, including all related intellectual
			property rights, in and to any suggestions, ideas, enhancement requests, feedback,
			recommendations or other information provided by you or any other party relating to the
			Services, whether provided in a User Submission or not.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you store a User Submission in your own personal Eola Pets account, in a manner that is not
			viewable by any other user except you (a "Personal User Submission"), you grant Eola Pets the
			license above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Personal User
			Submission for the sole purpose of making that Personal User Submission accessible to you and
			providing the Services necessary to do so.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you share a User Submission only in a manner that only certain specified users can view
			(for example, a private message to one or more other users)(a "Limited Audience User
			Submission"), then you grant Eola Pets the licenses above, as well as a license to display,
			perform, and distribute your Limited Audience User Submission for the sole purpose of making
			that Limited Audience User Submission accessible to such other specified users, and providing
			the Services necessary to do so. Also, you grant such other specified users a license to
			access that Limited Audience User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as
			permitted by the functionality of the Services.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you share a User Submission publicly on the Services and/or in a manner that more than just
			you or certain specified users can view (a "Public User Submission"), then you grant Eola Pets
			the licenses above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Public User
			Submission for the purpose of making that Public User Submission accessible to all Eola Pets
			users and providing the Services necessary to do so, as well as all other rights necessary to
			use and exercise all rights in that Public User Submission in connection with the Services for
			any purpose. Also, you grant all other users of the Services a license to access that Public
			User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality
			of the Services.
		</p>
		<p>
			You agree that the licenses you grant are royalty-free, perpetual, sublicenseable,
			irrevocable, and worldwide.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally, you understand and agree that Eola Pets, in performing the required technical steps
			to provide the Services to our users (including you), may need to make changes to your User
			Submissions to conform and adapt those User Submissions to the technical requirements of
			connection networks, devices, services, or media, and the foregoing licenses include the
			rights to do so.
		</p>
		<h4>Third Party Interactions</h4>
		<p>
			During your use of the Services, you may enter into correspondence with, purchase goods and/or
			services from, or participate in promotions of third party service providers, advertisers or
			sponsors showing their goods and/or services through the Services. Any such activity, and any
			terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such activity, is solely
			between you and the applicable third-party. Eola Pets and its licensors shall have no
			liability, obligation or responsibility for any such correspondence, purchase, transaction or
			promotion between you and any such third-party. Eola Pets does not endorse any sites on the
			Internet that are linked through the Services, and in no event shall Eola Pets or its
			licensors be responsible for any content, products, services or other materials on or
			available from such sites or third party providers. You recognize that certain third-party
			providers of goods and/or services may require your agreement to additional or different terms
			and conditions prior to your use of or access to such goods or services, and Eola Pets
			disclaims any and all responsibility or liability arising from such agreements between you and
			the third party providers.
		</p>
		<p>
			Eola Pets may rely on third party advertising and marketing supplied through the Services and
			other mechanisms to subsidize the Services. By agreeing to these terms and conditions you
			agree to receive such advertising and marketing. If you do not want to receive such
			advertising you should notify us in writing. Eola Pets reserves the right to charge you a
			higher fee for the Services should you choose not to receive these advertising services. This
			higher fee, if applicable, will be posted on Eola Pets' website located at
			<a href="/">https://www.eolapets.com</a>
			. Eola Pets may compile and release information regarding you and your use of the Services on an
			anonymous basis as part of a customer profile or similar report or analysis. You agree that it
			is your responsibility to take reasonable precautions in all actions and interactions with any
			third party you interact with through the Services.
		</p>
		<h4>Indemnification</h4>

			permitted by applicable law, that you shall defend, indemnify and hold Eola Pets, its
			licensors and each such party's parent organizations, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers,
			directors, members, employees, attorneys, assigns and agents harmless from and against any and

			EOLA PETS' SERVICES MAY BE SUBJECT TO LIMITATIONS, DELAYS, AND OTHER PROBLEMS INHERENT IN THE

		</p>
		<p>
			EOLA PETS' SERVICES MAY BE USED BY YOU TO REQUEST AND SCHEDULE PET CARE SERVICES WITH PET CARE

		<p>
			THE LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMER IN THIS SECTION DO NOT PURPORT TO LIMIT LIABILITY OR ALTER YOUR
			RIGHTS AS A CONSUMER THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.
		</p>
		<h4>Notice</h4>
		<p>
			Eola Pets may give notice by means of a general notice on the Services, electronic mail to
			your email address on record in Eola Pets' account information, or by written communication
			sent by first class mail or pre-paid post to your address on record in Eola Pets' account
			information. Such notice shall be deemed to have been given upon the expiration of 48 hours
			after sending. You may give notice to Eola Pets (such notice shall be deemed given when
			received by Eola Pets) by sending an electronic mail message to Eola Pets at:
			<a href="mailto:legal@eolapets.com">legal@eolapets.com</a>
			.
		</p>
		<h4>Assignment</h4>
		<p>
			These Terms may not be assigned by you without the prior written approval of Eola Pets but may
			be assigned at any time by Eola Pets to:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>a parent or subsidiary</li>
			<li>an acquirer of assets</li>
			<li>a successor by merger</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Any purported assignment in violation of this section shall be void.</p>
		<h4>Term And Termination Of Terms</h4>
		<p>
			These Terms are effective upon your access or use of the Services. You or Eola Pets may
			terminate your participation in the Services at any time, for any reason and Eola Pets may
			prohibit your use of the Services at any time in its sole discretion. These Terms, and any
			subsequent modification of these Terms, shall remain in effect at all times after you or Eola
			Pets terminate your participation or access to the Services.
		</p>
		<h4>Disputes/Mandatory Individual Arbitration</h4>
		<p>
			Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of the Services will be resolved by
			binding arbitration on an individual basis, rather than in court, except that you may assert
			claims in small claims court if your claims qualify. ANY ARBITRATION UNDER THESE TERMS WILL
			TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS; CLASS ARBITRATIONS AND CLASS ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. The
			Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Disputes" or "claims" under this provision shall include, but are not limited to, any
			dispute, claim or controversy, whether based on past, present, or future events, arising out
			of or relating to: the Terms and prior versions thereof (including the breach, termination,
			enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof), the Services, any other goods or services
			made available through the Services, your relationship with Eola Pets, the threatened or
			actual suspension, deactivation or termination of your account with Eola Pets, payments made
			by you or any payments made or allegedly owed to you, any promotions or offers made by Eola
			Pets, any claims for fraud, defamation, emotional distress, breach of any express or implied
			contract or covenant, claims arising under federal or state consumer protection laws; claims
			arising under antitrust laws, claims arising under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and
			Fair Credit Reporting Act; and claims arising under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, Civil
			Rights Act of 1964, Americans With Disabilities Act, and state statutes, if any, addressing
			the same or similar subject matters, and all other federal and state statutory and common law
			claims. All disputes concerning the arbitrability of a claim (including disputes about the
			scope, applicability, enforceability, revocability or validity of the Arbitration Agreement)
			shall be decided by the arbitrator, except as expressly provided below.
		</p>
		<p>
			There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited.
			However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court
			(including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow these
			Terms as a court would.
		</p>
		<p>
			To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and
			describing your claim to
			<a href="mailto:legal@eolapets.com">legal@eolapets.com</a>
			. We will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines
			the claims are frivolous. Likewise, Eola Pets will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration
			unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. You may choose to have the arbitration
			conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live
			or at another mutually agreed location.
		</p>
		<p>
			WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL
			BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. The arbitrator shall have no
			authority to consider or resolve any claim or issue any relief on any basis other than an
			individual basis. The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any claim or
			issue any relief on a class, collective, or representative basis. Other than disputes
			regarding the validity of the class action waiver contained herein, which disputes may be
			resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction, all disputes regarding the scope and
			validity of these Terms will be resolved by the arbitrator.
		</p>
		<p>
			If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right
			to a jury trial. We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin
			infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights.
		</p>
		<h4>General</h4>
		<p>
			No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you, Eola
			Pets or any third party provider as a result of these Terms or use of the Services.
		</p>
		<p>
			If any provision of the Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be
			struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced to the fullest extent under law.
		</p>
		<p>
			The failure of Eola Pets to enforce any right or provision in these Terms shall not constitute
			a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by Eola Pets in writing.
		</p>
		<p>
			These Terms comprise the entire agreement between you and Eola Pets and supersedes all prior
			or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions or terms, whether written or oral, between the
			parties regarding the subject matter contained herein. If any provision of these Terms is or
			becomes invalid or non-binding, the parties shall remain bound by all other provisions hereof.
			In that event, the parties will replace the invalid or non- binding provision with provisions
			that are valid and binding and that have, to the greatest extent possible, a similar effect as
			the invalid or non-binding provision, given the contents and purpose of these Terms.
		</p>
		<h4>Third Party Applications</h4>
		<p>
			The Services may be available or accessed in connection with Eola Pets applications
			("Applications") made available by third party providers such as Apple, Inc., or Google, Inc.
			("Provider") through their storefronts such as the App Store and Google Play.
		</p>
